##	The Seal & The Shark

The young Seal slid down the ice to the edge of the ocean, ready for a day of play. At the edge of the water a group stood near the head of a large Shark that peered up from the water. “Come in and swim. The water is fine today. Look at how I enjoy the ocean all to myself.“

An old Seal shook its head. “Forgive us Shark, we do not wish to offend. Your teeth gleam with sharpness. Your body moves in endless ravenousness. Your eyes watch with desperation.”

The Shark shook his head “I thought you Seals more civilized. I cannot change my teeth, my body, or my eyes. Can I not be a Shark and a friend for us to swim together in enjoyment of the same waters?” 

The young Seal shrugged and had thought about it enough. Assured by the words, he jumped into the cool shadows of the ocean.

In an instant the Shark leapt forward and swallowed the young Seal whole, swimming away never to be seen again.

##	The Seahorse & The Turtle

A mother Seahorse was preparing lunch one day, and summoned her youngest to her kitchen.  "Young one, go fetch us the most delicious seaweed from the rocks close to the shore."  "Yes mother" the young Seahorse said as as she swam out of their rocky home and into the warm water they lived.  

Along the way the Seahorse thought to herself. "How will I know the most delicious when I see it?".  Along her way she saw the wise Turtle swimming to keep healthy.  "I will ask Turtle, he knows all that lives along the shore!"

"Wise Turtle, my mother sent me to find the most delicious seaweed from the rocks, please tell me which ones those are so I can go back to my hungry brothers and sisters quickly."  The Turtle slowed and smiled, "Of course, young one, I know all that lives here on the shore from my many years, what you seek are the seaweed the color of amaranth."

The Seahorse nodded greatfully and swam away quickly, but did not get far before she slowed her tail.  "Amaranth ... I do not know this color.  How will I find the most delicious seaweed for a color I have never seen?"  The Seahorse wiggled her tail quickly swimming back to the wise Turtle who was swimming another lap.

"Wise Turtle, I left so quickly, but did not ask: I do not know the color of amaranth, how can I know a word i've never seen?"  The turtle smiled and slowed from his exercise.  "Of course young one, the color you seek is the color of the Octopus skin at the end of the coral in the morning light."

The Seahorse tilted back, remembering the Octopus.  He had the most beautiful skin and it did look quite majestic in the morning light. "Oh, you should have just said so, Thank you!", and swam off to find lunch for her family.
